Good morning, everyone.

Yesterday, I optimized the attachment performance test based on the soak script report and reran it. I also analyzed the reasons for the errors in CustomerNotifyService.

Today, I will continue to fix the errors in CustomerNotifyService. Once that is done, I will start adding unit tests for GL.

No risks at the moment.
