Good morning, everyone.  
Yesterday, I mainly fixed Sonar issues in the notification-details code and worked on making the PR checks pass. I also resolved several API-licence issues in pa-notifications.  
Today, I will continue fixing the remaining API-licence issues for PA-notifications and draft the API-design document. 
No risks at the moment.
