Good morning, everyone.

Yesterday, I continued to monitor the API license issues and then started the performance testing for the attachment, preparing some scripts.

Today, I will continue with the performance testing for the attachment. Once that is done, I will start adding unit tests for GL.

No risks at the moment.
