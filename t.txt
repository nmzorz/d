Good morning, everyone.
Yesterday, I focused on improving the Sonar and PR checks for notification-details to green, added more unit tests, and fixed several API-license issues.
Today, I will continue improving the PR check to green and fixing the remaining API-license problems. Once that is done, I will start the "create new endpoint" task.
No risks at the moment.
