Good morning, everyone.  
Yesterday, I tested the e-mail sending of the new endpoint and fixed the “similar” issue flagged in the API-license check.  
Today I’ll begin the release preparation for mail-handle.  
No risks at the moment.


### 中文文稿  
学习语言是一项充满挑战但又极具回报的旅程。以下是五个我认为非常有效的学习方法：  

1. **沉浸式学习**：首先，尽可能多地让自己置身于目标语言的环境中，例如通过看电影、听音乐、阅读书籍或与母语者交流。  
2. **每日坚持练习**：此外，语言学习需要持续性，哪怕每天只花15-20分钟，也能有效巩固记忆和提升语感。  
3. **实用场景应用**：不仅如此，将语言学习与实际生活场景结合，比如点餐、问路或写邮件，还能增强实用性和记忆深度。  
4. **多样化学习资源**：同时，利用应用程序、在线课程、播客等不同工具，可以保持学习的新鲜感和趣味性。  
5. **不怕犯错，积极反馈**：最后，要大胆开口说和写，从错误中学习，并主动寻求老师或同伴的反馈以不断改进。

### English Translation  
Learning a language is a challenging yet highly rewarding journey. Here are five methods I find particularly effective:  

1. **Immersive Learning**: First, surround yourself with the target language as much as possible—for example, through movies, music, books, or conversations with native speakers.  
2. **Consistent Daily Practice**: Additionally, language learning requires consistency. Even just 15-20 minutes daily can effectively reinforce memory and improve language sense.  
3. **Practical Application**: Moreover, integrating language learning into real-life situations, such as ordering food, asking for directions, or writing emails, can enhance practicality and retention.  
4. **Diverse Learning Resources**: Meanwhile, utilizing various tools like apps, online courses, and podcasts helps keep learning engaging and fun.  
5. **Embrace Mistakes and Seek Feedback**: Finally, don’t be afraid to speak or write boldly. Learn from errors, and actively seek feedback from teachers or peers to improve continuously.  

希望这些建议对大家的语言学习有所帮助！Good luck with your language learning journey!
