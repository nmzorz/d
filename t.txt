Good morning, everyone.
Yesterday, I kicked off the mail-handle release preparation—compiled([kəmˈpaɪld]) the documents and created the CR.
Today I’ll continue the release-preparation tasks.
No risks at the moment.

Hello everyone,
Today I'd like to share a few  English words that I have found a bit tricky([ˈtrɪki]) to pronounce. 
The first one is Archive( [ˈɑːkaɪv]). We use this word all the time for backups and logs. the correct pronunciation is actually ( [ˈɑːkaɪv]). The 'ch' is silent.
The second word is  “cache([kæʃ])”. Someone pronounced it “catch”. It’s /kæʃ/, one soft “sh” at the end.
The third word is Asynchronous( [eɪˈsɪŋkrənəs]), The key is to put the stress on the right syllable( [ˈsɪləbl])
Finally, there's Query() [ˈkwɪəri]. We query databases every day. the standard pronunciation should be ( [ˈkwɪəri]), with a short 'i' sound.
Thanks for listening
