Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, I was mainly working on the Release Preparation task, preparing CR-related content and test evidence. I also provided some support for the eSignature testing on the Kunlun side. Today, I will continue to fix Sonar issues for AccountOpenService. If there are any problems with the eSignature integration on the Kunlun side, I will provide support. There are no risks at the moment.
