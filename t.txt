Good morning,everyone.Yesterday,I was mainly working on the Release Preparation task,learning some content related to CR,and following the links and videos previously sent by Ken to carry out the operations.Today,I will continue with the Release Preparation,aiming to complete it.If there are any issues with the eSignature integration on the Kunlun side,I will provide support.There are no risks for now.
