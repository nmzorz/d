Over the past year, I’ve mastered the team’s core workflows, taking ownership of most tasks for SHP API licensing and release preparation to ensure their stability. Technically, I investigated our code quality tool's source code and led knowledge-sharing sessions, elevating team standards. I also eliminated reams of repetitive “Code to Value” mapping with an annotation and AOP refactor, cutting boilerplate and boosting dev speed. Next year  I will continue to deepen my technical expertise, share knowledge to empower the team, and translate these efforts into greater business impact.

Good morning, everyone.

Yesterday, I worked on adding the corresponding API contracts for the endpoints delivered earlier.

Today, I'll continue with this work to complete the API contracts and then move on to drafting the API design document.

No risks at the moment.
